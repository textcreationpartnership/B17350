            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Right Honourable,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Remember I told you in my last, that our Affairs here, looked at that time with a cloudy face, but I was confident in my next to you, that you would hear of a change, expecting hourely the arrivall of the Forces designed hither, which are now safely landed, and seasonably, Gods time being alwaies the best, since which time it hath pleased God to shew himselfe mightily, in giving the small Remnant of his Servants here, a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Victory. On Thursday last, 2 instant, the enemies Army, who had before removed their Camp from the North side of the Town, to the Southside, and was incamped within two miles of it, at a place called the Remainds, sent a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of about 400 men to possesse themselves of an old ruinous House, caled Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatrash, a mile from the City, (intending as it should seem, to draw neer to the Town with their Army) the Governour sent out a party against them, and speedily followed himself, with about 3000 Foot, and 1200 Horse, &amp; after a sharp dispute there, that party of the Enemies were all kild and taken. Col: <hi>Jones</hi> from thence marched against another Body, which the Enemy had drawn forth, and routed them, fell into the Enemies Camp, and routed the whole Army, took all their great Guns, tents, Bagge and Baggage, slew 4000. and took 2100. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prisoners, and neer 300 Officers, <hi>Ormond</hi> himselfe scaped away as I heard, with 7 Horse. The Earl of <hi>Fingall,</hi> and <hi>Ormonds</hi> Brother are taken, with some other Prisoners of Quality, and many of Quality slaine. Sir <hi>Will. Vaughan</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest, and many that I cannot name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is a report that my Lord <hi>Taffe</hi> is slaine, but that I thinke is not certaine. The Earle of <hi>Castlehaven</hi> was wounded, but carried off by the enemy, but whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dead or alive I know not. The enemy speake themselves to be <hi>19000.</hi> but it is thought they were <hi>14000.</hi> at the least: They had the best Traine of Artillery that was ever seen in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is now ours. Their Campe was rich, having newly received mony for the paying of their Army.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir, Thus you see this numerous and strong Army vanquished and destroyed by a handfull, because God owned his servants in the day of battell. I was yesterday with the Governour, whose care and gallantry hath been admirably shown in preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Parliaments interest here, whom I doubt not will return him a respect suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his merits. The Lord <hi>Inchequeen</hi> with a party of Horse was gone for <hi>Munster</hi> some few dayes before the fight, but the Governour presented mee with his sword, that was taken in the field, it seems he left some part of his Forces, and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage behind him. I have sent <hi>20</hi> sail of ships and barks from hence to <hi>Milford</hi> and the expedition, Concord, President, Thomas and Nichodemus to waite the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Lord Lieutenant, Sir I am</hi>
